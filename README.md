# CHIP-8 Emulator (.NET 9)

This is a CHIP-8 emulator written in **.NET 9**, designed for clarity, maintainability, and modular architecture.

While the initial version of the codebase was generated using an AI-assisted tool, significant effort was invested in **refactoring the code**, **improving the project structure**, and **enhancing overall readability**. The result is a cleaner, more modular emulator that aims to be educational as well as functional.

## Features

- Fully functional CHIP-8 emulator core
- Clean, organized project structure
- Emphasis on code clarity and maintainability
- Written in modern C# with .NET 9

## Goals

- Provide a readable and well-structured implementation of a CHIP-8 emulator
- Serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in emulation or .NET development
- Demonstrate how AI-generated code can be improved and brought to production-level quality through human insight and architectural decisions

## Getting Started

To run the emulator:

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project using .NET 9 SDK
3. Run the executable and load a CHIP-8 ROM

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Requirements

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- A valid CHIP-8 ROM file to test
